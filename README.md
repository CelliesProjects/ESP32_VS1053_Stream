# ESP32_VS1053_Stream

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/7571166c872e4dc8a899382389b73f8e)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/CelliesProjects/ESP32_VS1053_Stream?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=CelliesProjects/ESP32_VS1053_Stream&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

A streaming library for esp32 with a separate vs1053 mp3/ogg/aac/flac/wav decoder.

This library plays mp3, ogg, aac, aac+ and flac files and streams. 

Supports http, https (insecure mode) and chunked audio streams.

You need [ESP_VS1053_Library](https://github.com/baldram/ESP_VS1053_Library) to communicate with the decoder.

Check out [eStreamPlayer32_VS1053](https://github.com/CelliesProjects/eStreamPlayer32_VS1053) to see a project using this library.

## How to install

Install [ESP_VS1053_Library](https://github.com/baldram/ESP_VS1053_Library) and `ESP32_VS1053_Stream` in your Arduino library folder.

## Known issues

From Arduino ESP32 core version 2.0.3 onwards HTTPClient has some issues that will be addressed as soon as I can find the time to debug and solve this.

For now use the Arduino ESP32 core version 1.0.6 for troublefree streaming.

## Example code

```c++
#include <VS1053.h>               /* https://github.com/baldram/ESP_VS1053_Library */
#include <ESP32_VS1053_Stream.h>

#define VS1053_CS     5
#define VS1053_DCS    21
#define VS1053_DREQ   22

ESP32_VS1053_Stream stream;

const char* SSID = "xxx";
const char* PSK = "xxx";

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);

    WiFi.begin(SSID, PSK);

    Serial.println("\n\nSimple vs1053 Streaming example.");

    while (!WiFi.isConnected())
        delay(10);
    Serial.println("wifi connected - starting decoder");

    SPI.begin();  /* start SPI before starting decoder */

    stream.startDecoder(VS1053_CS, VS1053_DCS, VS1053_DREQ);

    Serial.println("decoder running - starting stream");

    stream.connecttohost("http://icecast.omroep.nl/radio6-bb-mp3");

    Serial.print("codec: ");
    Serial.println(stream.currentCodec());

    Serial.print("bitrate: ");
    Serial.print(stream.bitrate());
    Serial.println("kbps");

}

void loop() {
    stream.loop();
}

void audio_showstation(const char* info) {
    Serial.printf("showstation: %s\n", info);
}

void audio_showstreamtitle(const char* info) {
    Serial.printf("streamtitle: %s\n", info);
}

void audio_eof_stream(const char* info) {
    Serial.printf("eof: %s\n", info);
}
```

## Functions

### Initialize the VS1053 codec

-  `stream.startDecoder(CS, DCS, DREQ)`

Will return `true` or `false` depending on the result.

### Starting or resuming a stream

-  `stream.connecttohost(url)`

Will return `true` or `false` depending on the result.

You can resume (or start playing with an offset) by requesting a stream with

-  `stream.connecttohost(url, startrange)`

For streams that need login credentials use

-  `stream.connecttohost(url, user, pwd)`

### Stopping or pausing a stream

Stop a stream with:

-  `stream.stopSong()` 

Pause a stream with:

-  `stream.stopSong(VS1053_RESUME)`

#### Example how to pause a stream

```c++
const String HOST = "http://some_file_with_a_filesize";

stream.connecttohost(HOST);

//[stream starts playing from the start]

const size_t FILE_POS = stream.position();
stream.stopSong(VS1053_RESUME);

//[stream is paused]

stream.connecttohost(HOST, FILE_POS);

//[stream will resume from FILE_POS]

```
This is only needed on real files. Radiostreams always return `0` on `stream.position()` and `stream.size()`.

If a stream reaches EOF `stream.stopSong()` is called automagically. 
<br>In that case you can use `stream.connecttohost(NEW_HOST)` without first calling `stream.stopSong()`.

### Feeding the decoder

-  `stream.loop()`

This function has to called every couple of ms to feed the decoder with data.

### Check if stream is running

-  `stream.isRunning()`

Will return `true` or `false`.

### Get the current volume

-  `stream.getVolume()`

### Set the volume

-  `stream.setVolume(value)`

Value should be between 0-100.

### Set bass and treble

`uint8_t rtone[4]  = {toneha, tonehf, tonela, tonelf};`

-  `stream.setTone(rtone)`

Values should be:
```
toneha       = <0..15>        // Setting treble gain (0 off, 1.5dB steps)
tonehf       = <0..15>        // Setting treble frequency lower limit x 1000 Hz
tonela       = <0..15>        // Setting bass gain (0 = off, 1dB steps)
tonelf       = <0..15>        // Setting bass frequency lower limit x 10 Hz
```

### Get the currently used codec
-  `stream.currentCodec()`

Return a string with the currently used codec.
Returns `UNKNOWN` if no stream is running.

### Get the filesize
-  `stream.size()`

Will return `0` if the stream is a radio stream.

### Get the current position in the stream
-  `stream.position()`

Will return `0` if the stream is a radio stream.

### Get the current url
-  `stream.lastUrl()`

The current stream url might differ from the request url if the request url points to a playlist.

## Event callbacks

-  `audio_showstation(const char* info)`

Returns the station name.

-  `audio_showstreamtitle(const char* info)`

Returns ICY stream information.

-  `audio_eof_stream(const char* info)`

Is called when the current stream reaches the end of file.
